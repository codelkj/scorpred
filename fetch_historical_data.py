"""
fetch_historical_data.py — Bulk-fetch historical soccer match results from
API-Football and append them to data/historical_matches.csv.

Usage:
    python fetch_historical_data.py           # fetch and append
    python fetch_historical_data.py --dry-run # preview without writing

Pulls the last SEASONS_BACK completed seasons for every league defined in
league_config.SUPPORTED_LEAGUE_IDS, deduplicates against existing rows, and
writes the enriched CSV back.

Output schema (superset of existing CSV schema):
    date, home_team, away_team, form, goals_scored, goals_conceded,
    goal_diff, result, league_id, season

Columns not present in existing rows (league_id, season, form) are left empty;
train_model.py only reads: date, home_team, away_team, goals_scored,
goals_conceded, result — all of which are present in both old and new rows.
