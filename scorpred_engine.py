scorpred_engine.py — Scorpred Weighted Prediction Engine

Scoring model (all components scored 0-10, final score 0-10):
  Form Score                (39%)  Win=+2, Draw=+1, Loss=0 · recency weights · margin bonus
  Offensive Strength        (14%)  Avg goals/pts scored in last 5 + trend adjustment
  Defensive Strength        (14%)  Avg goals/pts conceded in last 5 (fewer = higher)
  Head-to-Head Score         (9%)  Last 5 meetings, recency-weighted · recent H2H > old H2H
  Home/Away Advantage        (8%)  Moderate venue boost — real form data, not hardcoded
  Match Context              (5%)  Rest and fatigue from last match spacing
  Squad Availability         (4%)  Injury impact — role-weighted positional impact
  Opponent Strength Adj      (7%)  Adjusts form value by quality of opponents faced

Recency weights applied to last 5 matches (most recent first):
  1st = 40%,  2nd = 25%,  3rd = 15%,  4th = 10%,  5th = 10%

Final Team Score =
  (Form × 0.39) + (Offense × 0.14) + (Defense × 0.14) + (H2H × 0.09)
  + (Home/Away × 0.08) + (Squad × 0.04) + (Opp Strength × 0.07) + (Match Context × 0.05)

Design rules:
  - H2H must NOT overpower current form
  - Venue is a moderate contextual boost, not a dominant factor
  - Opponent Strength separates inflated form from real form
  - Prefer current evidence over old narratives

Data Quality:
  - Strong: Recent form + H2H + opponent quality + injuries all available
  - Moderate: Some data missing but prediction still reliable
  - Limited: Minimal data — prediction based on limited information
